***Project objective:*** *Design and development of transmission systems for Electric Formula Student racing car*

**My contributions:**
* Determined the optimum transmission ratio, top speed, acceleration time, and power requirements of the teamâ€™s maiden EV
* Designed a planetary gearbox, calculated the gear bending and wear stresses based on AGMA standards followed by the validation
of results by performing FEA in ANSYS and KISSsoft software
* Designed an involute-splined electric motor shaft, performed fatigue failure analysis due to bending and torsional stresses, and
validated the results in ANSYS
* Performed modal analysis of the motor shaft in ANSYS to optimize its design against bending and torsional vibrations
